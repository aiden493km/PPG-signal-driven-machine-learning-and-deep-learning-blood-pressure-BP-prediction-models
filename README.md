# PPG-signal-driven-machine-learning-and-deep-learning-blood-pressure-BP-prediction-models
This is the 2024 SURF project of Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University. We proposed a solution: extracting BP features, using Random Forest algorithm to classify BP, and innovatively using Deep Learning model SEM-ResNet to predict BP.
